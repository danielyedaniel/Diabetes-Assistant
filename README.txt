Once entered into the entry screen, the user will face the option of accessing an established account, or creating a new one. 

->Accessing existing account:
Just enter the username of the user and the program will find the corresponding file.

->New user:

Main screen: 
The main screen consists of the fundamental functions of the program. This screen is where the user faces the different options they can choose from.

--Cool things--
Program has memory and a GUI.
Program is able to give previous readings for a sugar level to help user predict future levels. 

--Program Bugs--
-Do not enter information in text field that is invalid. Ex: putting sentence into prompt for sugar level as number. Program screen will become white and console will throw error.

-Do not change the information in the user files. This will mess up the program's ability to read information from the file.
